    Installation with all patterns selected for installation to check for
    potential package conflicts, how the system handles big space usage, etc.
    allpatterns installations can take longer, especially on non-x86_64
    architectures. This test suite doesn't publish an HDD, and doesn't run
    post-installation tests.
